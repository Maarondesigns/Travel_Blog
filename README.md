# My Travel Blog

This is my personal travel blog that I started building on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/maarondesigns/pen/jpmEWw) after returning from and 8.5 month trip around the world. I knew basic HTML, CSS and Javascript from building a Wordpress site a couple years back, but on returning from the trip, I decided to go full digitla nomad and learn Javascript thouroughly, which brought me eventually to the world of d3.js and node.js. 

Using those tools I created this site (which is still a work in progress) as a personal blog and my own travel app to continue documenting my travels.
